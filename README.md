This is an instruction for installing a package with games, a test, installing it and launching each individual brain game for calculating or checking numbers for a particular property with a video demonstration of each game.

Rules:
In each game you are asked a question that you must answer correctly depending on the conditions in the question
Each game is played up to the first wrong answer or up to three correct answers in each of the rounds.
If the answer is wrong the game ends, you lose. If you answer correctly three rounds in a row, then you win.
